# Battleship

Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players. It is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game 
which dates from World War I. It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a 
plastic board game by Milton Bradley in 1967. The purpose of the game is to destroy the opposing player's battleships, and ends 
with a fight to the death.

The game is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are typically square – usually 10×10 – and the individual squares
in the grid are identified by letter and number.[7] On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. 
On the other grid the player records their own shots.

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive 
squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of 
the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships 
allowed are the same for each player. 

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce
a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a 
ship, and if it is a "miss", the player marks their primary grid with a white peg; if a "hit" they mark this on their own primary 
grid with a red peg. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid with the appropriate color peg (red 
for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet. After the player gets a hit the player 
continues shooting until the player gets a miss.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces this (e.g. 
"You sank my battleship!"). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
